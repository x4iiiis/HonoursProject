Allow the player to toggle certain rules on and off. Rules have simplistic names but when hovered over they can be explained

Rules:
* Hints - Does the user want the game to help teach the rules as the game goes on?
* Force Hand - If you can play, you have to. (Dunno about this being available for toggling) 
* Ace - toggle between play on anything or play on same suit
* 2 Pick Up Two
* 7 Same Suit Runs (and runs on final card of same suit) 
* 8 or Wait
* Black Queen
* Red Queen
* Suicide King
* Jack Back
* [Insert swap hands rule here]
* Play on till someon comes last
